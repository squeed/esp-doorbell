#ESP-Doorbell.

I can't make copies of my apartment building's front door. However, the building
did kindly provide a pair of wires, where connecting one to the other unlocks
the door.

These wires happen to be inside the doorbell, but that's no big deal. The doorbell
has a special chassis for expansion boards!

So, in `/hardware` you'll see a schematic and board design that slots in to the
chassis.

In `/software` you'll find some fun things that will cause various requests to open the door.
